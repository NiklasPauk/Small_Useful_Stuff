## 01 - Bib-Cleaner

Small utility [file](https://github.com/NiklasPauk/Small_Useful_Stuff/blob/main/01_Bibtex_Cleaner/bib_cleaner.py) to clean a bibtex file to make it compatible with latex and remove unwanted fields. Customizable to replace symbols (e.g. the infinity symbol), make underscores latex save and remove unwanted fields from the generated bibtex file (e.g. the journal abstract or file location).
